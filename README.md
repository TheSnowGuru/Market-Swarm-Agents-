## üìà Market Swarm Agents üöÄ

Welcome to the **Market Swarm Agents** ‚Äì an open-source toolkit designed to bring the power of advanced AI agents to your financial market strategies. Imagine having a swarm of virtual analysts, each with their own unique trading style, working tirelessly to decode market signals and identify opportunities in real-time. Well, now you can!



### üß† What Is It?
This platform leverages advanced machine learning models and customizable trading strategies under a unified framework. It allows you to simulate and optimize a diverse set of agents:

- **Scalper Agent**: Specializes in high-frequency trading, executing quick entries and exits to capture small market movements.
- **Trend Follower Agent**: Identifies and rides long-term trends in the market, aiming to maximize profits from sustained price movements.
- **Correlation Agent**: Analyzes the relationships between various market assets to make informed trading decisions.

The **Master Agent** oversees all these agents, ranks their performance, allocates resources, and ensures optimal operation across the swarm.
