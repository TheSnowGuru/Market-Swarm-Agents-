### üß† What Is It?
This platform leverages advanced machine learning models and customizable trading strategies under a unified framework. It allows you to simulate and optimize a diverse set of agents:

- **Scalper Agent**: Specializes in high-frequency trading, executing quick entries and exits to capture small market movements.
- **Trend Follower Agent**: Identifies and rides long-term trends in the market, aiming to maximize profits from sustained price movements.
- **Correlation Agent**: Analyzes the relationships between various market assets to make informed trading decisions.

The **Master Agent** oversees all these agents, ranks their performance, allocates resources, and ensures optimal operation across the swarm.

### üî• Key Features
- **Hierarchical Agent Management**: The Master Agent supervises individual agents, tracks their performance, and allocates resources dynamically based on their effectiveness.
- **Integrated Short and Long Strategies**: Each agent can independently execute short and long strategies as part of its trading logic.
- **Live Monitoring and Performance Tracking**: Monitor the live status, performance metrics, and positions of each agent in real-time.
- **Dynamic Resource Allocation**: The Master Agent adjusts resources based on the performance and market conditions.
- **QuantStats Integration**: Analyze backtesting results with comprehensive performance reports generated by `quantstats`.
- **Scalable and Extensible**: Easily add or modify agents, strategies, and resource management rules.

### üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/multi-agent-market-analysis.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**: 
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
