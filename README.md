### üß† What Is It?
This platform leverages advanced machine learning models and customizable trading strategies under a unified framework. It allows you to simulate and optimize a diverse set of agents:

- **Scalper Agent**: Specializes in high-frequency trading, executing quick entries and exits to capture small market movements.
- **Trend Follower Agent**: Identifies and rides long-term trends in the market, aiming to maximize profits from sustained price movements.
- **Correlation Agent**: Analyzes the relationships between various market assets to make informed trading decisions.

The **Master Agent** oversees all these agents, ranks their performance, allocates resources, and ensures optimal operation across the swarm.

### üî• Key Features
- **Advanced Agent Ecosystem**: A sophisticated multi-agent system with specialized trading agents, each with unique market analysis strategies.
- **Hierarchical Agent Management**: The Master Agent supervises individual agents, dynamically tracks their performance, and allocates resources based on real-time effectiveness.
- **Comprehensive Testing Framework**: 
  - Integrated unit and integration testing with `pytest`
  - Code coverage reporting
  - Automated test discovery and execution via CLI
- **Flexible Strategy Execution**: 
  - Integrated short and long trading strategies
  - Independent agent strategy implementation
  - Dynamic strategy adaptation based on market conditions
- **Performance Monitoring & Analysis**:

  - Comprehensive performance metrics
  - Advanced backtesting with `quantstats` and `vectorbt`
- **Robust Data Handling**:
  - Multiple data source integrations
  - Advanced feature extraction
  - Timeframe and indicator preprocessing
- **Scalable Architecture**:
  - Modular agent design
  - Easy extension and customization
  - Pluggable strategy and resource management

### üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/market-swarm-agents.git
   cd market-swarm-agents
   ```
2. **Create Virtual Environment** (Recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**: 
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run Tests**: Validate your setup by running tests:
   ```bash
   python cli.py test  # Run unit tests
