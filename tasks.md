### âœ… Task List 

- [x] **1. User Input Setup and Interface**  
  - [x] Build a CLI to collect and control the strategy and agents:  
    - [x] load Asset csv from datafolder (e.g., BTC/USD, AAPL)  
    - [x] Select the Timeframe (e.g., 1m, 5m, 1h)  
    - [x] Select Indicators (e.g., EMA, RSI)  
    - [x] Add Extra parameters (e.g., volatility, volume zones)
    

- [ ] **2. Synthetic Data Creation**  
  - [x] Load historical data for the asset/timeframe  
  - [ ] Calculate and save new df for chosen indicators of the agent to create a the data set  .
  - [ ] Generate synthetic trades data df (Buy/Sell, loop at each bar buy/sell order,with SL/TP, results, indicator values at entry and exit)  
  - [ ] Use `numba` with `vectorbt` for fast processing  
  - [ ] save the entry price, signal type,  
  - [ ] Apply SL/TP with configurable RR  
  - [ ] Track trade exit and save winning trades in CSV  
  - [ ] Set default trade value of 100,000 account with 10,000 per each trade for the simulation. can be changed.
  - [ ] Record indicator values at trade entry/exit  
  - [ ] Compute trade metrics (PnL %, duration, volatility context, feature set)

- [ ] **3. Analze and Filter Profitable Trades**  
  - [ ] Load synthetic trade data  
  - [ ] Filter trades by RR threshold set in CLI  
  - [ ] Save only profitable trades in new df with the filtered thrshold per agent per strategy. 
  - [ ] Be able to add remove df for agent
  - [ ] Group df by PnL %, duration, drawdwon,  

- [ ] **4. Generating Optimal Trading Rules**  
  - [ ] Analyze filtered trades with plot using vectorbt 
  - [ ] Save rules as strategy profiles  
  - [ ] Explore decision trees or ML-based rule generation
  - [ ] Make simple "if-then" rules (e.g., "If RSI < 30 and EMA rises, Buy")  

- [ ] **5. Run Backtest of the Generated Strategy**  
  - [ ] Use vectorbt for backtest  
  - [ ] Display win rate, Sharpe ratio, PnL curve, drawdown

- [ ] **6. Connect to Master Agent**  
  - [ ] Send strategy ID, results, trade summary  
  - [ ] Enable master agent to track & adjust agent performance
