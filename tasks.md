### Task List for Developer

- [x] **1. User Input Setup and interface**  
  - Build a CLI to collect and control the strategy and agents:  
    - Asset (e.g., BTC/USD, AAPL)  
    - Timeframe (e.g., 1m, 5m, 1h)  
    - Indicators (e.g., EMA, RSI)  
    - Extra parameters (e.g., volatility, volume zones)

- [ ] **2. Synthetic Data Creation**  
  - Load historical data for the asset/timeframe  
  - Calculate chosen indicators of the agent in order to create a strategy 
  - Generate synthetic trades (Buy/Sell trades , loop at each bar, SL/TP, results, indicator values at trade entry and exit)  
  - use numba by vectorbt for fast processing of data.
  Generate Synthetic Trades

Loop through each candle/bar to simulate trades:

For each trade:

Determine entry price, buy sell signal, Apply Stop-Loss (SL) and Take-Profit (TP) targets (fixed or dynamic) and also have a parameter for called RR, which is the ratio between tp/sl and this can be played with during the cli setup to create the syntetic data. 

Track trade exit based on SL/TP hit , save only winning trades in a csv.

Record indicator values at entry and exit (for strategy training) all data should be saved, indicators, and time

Compute trade metrics (PnL %, duration, volatility context, feature ) 


- [ ] **3. Filter Profitable Trades**  
  - from the synthtic trade data we will save a df of winning trade only according to RR threshold that we set in the cli
  - Filter trades that meet profitability goal of RR 
  - Group by patterns or conditions (PnL %, duration, volatility context, feature ) 

- [ ] **4. generating optimal Trading Rules**  
  - Analyze filtered trades  
  - Make simple "if-then" rules (e.g., "If RSI < 30 and EMA rises, Buy")  
  - Save rules as a strategy profile
  - find better way to generate a strategy using decision trees or machine learning algofeatur

- [ ] **5. Run Backtest of the generated strategy**  
  - Use vectorbt to test the strategy  and see a plot
  - Show results: win rate, Sharpe ratio, PnL curve, drawdown

- [ ] **6. Connect to Master Agent**  
  - Send Strategy ID, backtest results, and trade summary to Master Agent  
  - Allow Master Agent to track and adjust agent performance# SWARM Trading System Tasks
