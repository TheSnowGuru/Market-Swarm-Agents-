### âœ… Task List

- [x] **1. User Input Setup and Interface**
  - [x] Build a CLI to collect and control the strategy and agents:
    - [x] load Asset csv from datafolder (e.g., BTC/USD, AAPL)
    - [x] Select the Timeframe (e.g., 1m, 5m, 1h)
    - [x] Select Indicators (e.g., EMA, RSI)
    - [x] Add Extra parameters (e.g., volatility, volume zones)


- [ ] **2. Synthetic Data Creation**
  - [x] Load historical data for the asset/timeframe use vectorbt
  - [x] Calculate indicators for the agent during trade generation using vectorbt.
  - [x] Generate synthetic trades data df (Buy/Sell entry/exit, SL/TP, results, indicator values at entry/exit) using vectorbt simulation.
  - [x] Use `numba` with `vectorbt` for fast processing (inherent in vectorbt usage).
  - [x] Apply SL/TP with configurable RR threshold (via CLI prompts and vectorbt parameters).
  - [ ] save trades and save trades in CSV (Saving all trades implemented; filtering winning trades handled in analysis workflow, generator-level filtering needs review).
  - [x] Set configurable account size and trade size via CLI prompts.
  - [x] Record indicator values at trade entry/exit points in the trades DataFrame.
  - [x] Compute comprehensive trade metrics (PnL %, duration, drawdown, etc.) using vectorbt's `Portfolio.stats()`.

- [ ] **3. Analze and Filter Profitable Trades as menu workflow**
  - [x] Load synthetic trade data (via `view_synthetic_trades` and analysis workflows).
  - [x] Filter trades by RR threshold and profit % set in CLI (`filter_trades_workflow`).
  - [x] Save only profitable trades in new df with the filtered thrshold (`filter_trades_workflow`).
  - [ ] Be able to add/replce or remove trade df for the agent strategy, be able to have for trades df of (asset)
  - [ ] Group df by PnL %, duration, drawdown,RR, Win Rate (Basic stats displayed, detailed grouping/analysis pending).

- [ ] **4. Generating Optimal Trading Rules**
  - [x] Analyze filtered trades with clustering (`identify_patterns_workflow`).
  - [x] Generate basic "if-then" rules from patterns (`generate_rules_workflow`).
  - [ ] Save rules as strategy profiles (JSON saving implemented, profile management pending).
  - [ ] Explore decision trees or ML-based rule generation.
  - [x] Visualize patterns and feature importance (`visualize_analysis_workflow`).


- [ ] **5. Run Backtest of the Generated Strategy**
  - [ ] Use vectorbt for backtest (Placeholder exists, needs full implementation).
  - [ ] Display win rate, Sharpe ratio, PnL curve, drawdown (Needs backtest implementation).

- [ ] **6. Connect to Master Agent**
  - [ ] Send strategy ID, results, trade summary
  - [ ] Enable master agent to track & adjust agent performance
